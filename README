DanceBattle is a node.js application that runs the minimax algorithm to determine who will win a dance battle where there
are a set number of dance moves, each player must repeat the previous player's second dance move as their first move
and then add a second move of their choice.  Dance move combos cannot be repeated.  This continues until there are no
legal combos left for a dancer.

The input is in the format
#
#
# #
# #
Where the first row is the number of legal moves
The second row is the number of moves entered by the user
every row after the second row represents the first moves
made by each dancer in the contest

Example inputs can be found in textInput.txt

Once Node.js is set up on your local machine, on the command line, navigate to the root directory which should
contain app.js, package.json, and your project files.  Type "npm start", open a browser, and navigate to "localhost:3000".
